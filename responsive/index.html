            <h1>US ready to help improve Chittagong Port infrastructure</h1>
            <p>US companies are ready to offer expertise and systems, including those to reduce congestion and boost efficiency, to improve the infrastructure at the Chittagong Port, according to chargé d’affaires at the US Embassy in Dhaka JoAnne Wagner, who recently conveyed the idea to Chittagong Port Authority chairman Rear Admiral SM Abul Kalam Azad.

                Wagner said the US Trade and Development Agency is eager to support infrastructure projects in high-growth emerging markets such as Bangladesh with feasibility studies, technical assistance and pilot projects.

                Wagner visited Chittagong recently to support the robust economic partnership between Bangladesh and the United States, said the Embassy in a press release.
                
                Wagner discussed expansion plans for the Chittagong Port, including opportunities for participation by US companies; engaged with female entrepreneurs pursuing successful businesses and overcoming gender discrimination; and explored further opportunities with the operators of Pahartali Textile and Hosiery Mills for using US-grown cotton.
                
                Pahartali Textile and Hosiery Mills is a unit of Ispahani Limited. Wagner discussed with Mirza Salman Ispahani, chairman of Ispahani Limited, further opportunities for using US-grown cotton to produce yarns for the knit and woven industries in Bangladesh.</p>
